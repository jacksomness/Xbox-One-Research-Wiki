# Facet

The FACET port is a universal debugging port on all models of the xbox one/series-family.

Features:

- SPI / eMMC
- I2C
- Kernel Debugging
- Southbridge JTAG

A special development board is used to interact with this port.
Some early development kits have the FACET circuitry on-board and feature a female USB-B port for connecting directly to a PC.

## Connector

Label: J4E1 (Xbox One PHAT/Xbox One S) or J22 (Xbox One X)

Connector: IDC 2x13P 2.00mm

Pinout

- SPI -> eMMC
- SB_JTAG -> Southbridge JTAG
- SMC_DBG -> SMC SWO Debug
- KER_DBG -> Kernel Debugging
